export const SERVICE_1_DESCRIPTION = `This service concerns a local decider who is a person in charge of an investment decision at a local level. This figure, having to choose a place to make an investment, needs to know the trend or how certain parameters have evolved in recent years. 
These parameters also concern the demographic evolution at a fine level. Therefore, it is cross-domain as it combines data of a different nature. 
The service is also cross-border as it allows the user to select two different areas (for example in Italy and France) to obtain a comparison and to finalize an international business. 
Therefore, this service does not just show data but also provides analysis tools to support these investors.
